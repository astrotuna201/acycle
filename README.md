```diff
+ With redesigned Acycle GUI, NO coding experience is required.
```

```diff
+ With Acycle stand-alone version, NO Matlab is needed.
```

Acycle is a comprehensive, but "user-friendly" software package for analysis
of time-series designed for paleoclimate research and education.
Acycle runs either in the MATLAB environment or as a stand-alone application
on Macintosh OS X and Windows, and is available free of charge.

<i>Acycle provides data preparation tools, detrending procedures with multiple options available
 to track or remove secular trends, and integrates various power spectral
 analysis approaches for detection and tracking of periodic signals.
Acycle also provides a toolbox that evaluates astronomical signals in
paleoclimate series, and estimates the most likely sedimentation rate
by maximizing the correlation coefficient between power spectra of
an astronomical solution and a paleoclimate series.
Sedimentary noise models for sea-level variations are also included.
Many of the functions are specific to cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology,
and are not found in standard, statistical packages. </i>

<b>*** *** 2. Mac version</b>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<b>*** *** 3. Windows version
</b>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b> v1. Acycle0.2.6-Win-green</b>
<br />
<br />
Green version. No installation needed. MatLab Runtime 2017a is essential.
<br />
(Step 1) Download Acycle0.2.6-Win-Installer

Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t53vjs539gmixnm/AAC0BqTR0U5xghKwuVc1Iwbma?dl=0), or

Baidu Cloud (https://pan.baidu.com/s/14-xRzV_-BBrE6XfyR_71Nw).
<br />
<br />
(Step 2) Download MatLab runtime R2017a here:
https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
<br />
<br />
(Step 3) Install MatLab runtime R2017a.
<br />
<br />
(Step 4) Run Acycle: Double-click Acycle.exe to run the software <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b> v2. Acycle0.2.6-Win-Installer</b>

<br />
(Step 1) Download Acycle0.2.6-Win-Installer

Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t53vjs539gmixnm/AAC0BqTR0U5xghKwuVc1Iwbma?dl=0), or

Baidu Cloud (https://pan.baidu.com/s/14-xRzV_-BBrE6XfyR_71Nw).
<br /><br />
(Step 2) Installation
<br /><br />
Double click “AcycleInstaller.exe” to install Acycle and MatLab runtime R2017a simultaneously. <br />
Following the instructions, you will get everything set. <br />
Downloading MatLab runtime R2017a can take a lot of time. The runtime needs 1 GB space. <br /><br />
(Step 3) Start-up <br /><br />
	You could just double click the Acycle icon on the desktop to start
	or start from the Windows “All Program” menu like any other software.

<br />

    However, I strongly recommend the following start-up method,
    which will enable a command window showing a lot of information about many time-consuming steps.
<br />
<br />
(Step 1) Use “Win + R” short-cut keys to start the “RUN” of Window<br />
Then in the pop-up window, type

    cmd
and click OK button.<br /><br />

(Step 2) Type following two lines of commend below in the command window. <br />

<i>For example, my Acycle software was installed under the directory “ C:\Program Files”, so it should be:<br /></i>

	cd C:\Program Files\Acycle\application\
	Acycle

The Acycle will start <br />

    Warning: the first-time start-up can be extremely slow.

    Warning: Never close the command window when Acycle is running.
             The commend window will keep on showing information when it runs time-consuming steps.

<br />
<br />
<b>*** *** Data requirement
</b>
<br />
<br />
<br />
See example data at https://github.com/mingsongli/acycle/tree/master/data
<br /><br />
The input file of data series can be in a variety of formats,
including table- or space-delimited text (.txt),
and comma-separated values files (.csv) from an Excel-type spreadsheet.

The data file must contain two columns of series.

The first column must be in depth or time, and the second column
should be value in the corresponding depth or time.

Unit of the series in depth domain should be in meters.

The data can be saved in any directory.
All data files, plots, and folders are displayed in the GUI list box.

    Still have no idea, don't worry. Try this, you’ll have a perfect example:

    Choose “Basic Series” menu --  select "Insolation" -- Click “OK” button

    Double-click generated file “Insol-t-1-1000ka-day-80-lat-65-meandaily-La04.txt” for details.
    Double-click the "Open Working Folder" icon, you will see this new text file in the working folder.
